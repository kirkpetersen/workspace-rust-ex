# workspace-rust-ex

This is an experiment in creating a "shell" or "workspace". I like working
in command-line shells, but bash is pretty old and crufty.

Also, having a shell work on a single computer is not very "cloud-like".
I'd prefer that the shell provide easy mechanisms for manipulating data
that lives in various places, and automatically storing data in places
where it can be retrieved from other computers.

Since I know AWS, I'm going to use various AWS resources.

I'm learning Rust, so that will be the language.
